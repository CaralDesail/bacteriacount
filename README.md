# bacteriacount

This is a scipt based on my learnings about data sciences and ML (thanks to https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmpptkXu8iIFe6kfDK5o7VQ , Machine learnia courses).



You just have 3 steps to use it:
- change the name of the image to load.
- change the detection threshold of bacteria.
- change the count of bacteria according to their size using the histogram.
